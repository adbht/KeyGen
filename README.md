## Inspiration
Cyber security has always been a threat to the society. Unfortunately most of the people take their account security for granted by having very predictable if not easy to crack passwords simply for their convenience and ease of typing every time they log in. KeyGen provides a solution by generating randomized keys with wide variety of options on whether to include letters, digits, and/or symbols from a range of 2 to 30 characters. The passwords can then be copied to clipboard encouraging users to use secure passwords and keep their accounts safe. 

## About
KeyGen is a simple and minimal key/password generating application developed for iOS using Swift 4 on Xcode. Giving the users to choose a password length from 2 to 30 characters using UI Slider, and an option of involving letters, digits, and symbols with UI Switches, KeyGen generates different types of passwords and also allows the users to copy their new passwords to the clipboard.

## Instructions to simulate
   - Install the following folders: [KeyGen](https://github.com/adbht/KeyGen/tree/master/KeyGen), [KeyGenTests](https://github.com/adbht/KeyGen/tree/master/KeyGenTests), and [KeyGenUITests](https://github.com/adbht/KeyGen/tree/master/KeyGenUITests)
   - Install [KeyGen.xcodeproj.zip](https://github.com/adbht/KeyGen/blob/master/KeyGen.xcodeproj.zip) and extract this zip file
   - Save these files and folders under a single folder with the name ```KeyGen```
   - Open Xcode from Applications
   - On the 'Welcome to Xcode' page you should see an existing project with the name ```KeyGen```. Click on this project.
   - Once the Xcode has finished loading the project, click on the play button (triangle shaped logo) on the top left corner of the Xcode screen. Done! (If you wish to simulate the application on another iOS device, click on the third button on the right of the play button which mentions an iOS device. This is the default iOS device Xcode has chosen to simulate in. You may choose to change the device to another iPhone or iPad model)
