## About
KeyGen is a simple and minimal key/password generating application developed for iOS using Swift 4 on Xcode. Giving the users to choose a password length from 2 to 30 characters using UI Slider, and an option of involving letters, digits, and symbols with UI Switches, KeyGen generates different types of passwords and also allows the users to copy their new passwords to the clipboard.

## Instructions to simulate
   - Open Terminal from Applications
   - Change the directory to where you would like to save this project using ```cd``` command
   - Type ```git clone https://github.com/adbht/KeyGen.git``` in Terminal
   - Extract [KeyGen.xcodeproj.zip](https://github.com/adbht/KeyGen/blob/master/KeyGen.xcodeproj.zip)
   - Open Xcode from Applications
   - On the 'Welcome to Xcode' page you should see an existing project with the name ```KeyGen```. Click on this project.
   - Once the Xcode has finished loading the project, click on the play button (triangle shaped logo) on the top left corner of the Xcode screen. Done! (If you wish to simulate the application on another iOS device, click on the third button on the right of the play button which mentions an iOS device. This is the default iOS device Xcode has chosen to simulate in. You may choose to change the device to another iPhone or iPad model)
